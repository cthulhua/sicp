# SICP exercises
This repo is just where I'm working through the SICP exercises as my friends and I read SICP in our book club.

The code directory contains the code from the book, curl'ed from [the SICP website](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)while the exercises directory contains the exercises with solutions, broken up into racket files by the sections we're progressing through the book in.
